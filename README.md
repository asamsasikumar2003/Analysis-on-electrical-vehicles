# Project Title: Analysis-on-electrical-vehicles

# Objective :
* To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Electric Vehicle data to identify key factors influencing vehicle performance, energy efficiency, battery usage, charging behavior, and consumer preferences.
* This analysis will help uncover insights that can drive innovation in EV design, optimize battery life, and improve the overall user experience.
# Libraries Used:

* Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
* NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling.
* Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and plotting the distribution of scores.
* Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models (e.g., regression, classification).
* Statsmodels: For statistical modeling and hypothesis testing.
* Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and documentation.
# Key areas to explore in EDA for EV:
1. Battery Performance:

    * Analyze factors affecting battery degradation and energy consumption over time.
    * Understand the relationship between driving patterns (speed, distance, terrain) and battery life.

2. Charging Behavior:

    * Study patterns in charging frequency, duration, and locations (home, public, fast-charging stations).
    * Examine the impact of charging habits on overall energy efficiency and battery longevity.

3. Range Anxiety:

    * Investigate the distribution of driving range for different types of EVs and driving conditions.
    * Analyze how range varies with temperature, vehicle load, and driving habits.

4. Energy Consumption:

    * Explore how factors like vehicle weight, speed, air conditioning usage, and weather conditions impact energy     consumption.
    * Identify trends in energy usage over time or based on environmental conditions.

5. Consumer Preferences:
    
    * Use data on sales, reviews, or surveys to understand what features (e.g., range, price, design, charging time) are most important to EV buyers.
    * Analyze how these preferences differ across demographic groups (age, income, geography).

6. Cost Efficiency:
    
    * Examine the relationship between EV operational costs (e.g., electricity, maintenance) and traditional fuel vehicles.
    * Explore how government incentives, rebates, or taxes influence EV adoption.

7. Environmental Impact:
    
    * Analyze the reduction in CO2 emissions or fuel consumption achieved through EV adoption.
    * Compare the energy consumption of EVs with traditional vehicles under similar conditions.
# Task : project was to create a racing bar chart :
* To compare the production performance of top electric vehicle manufacturers using the given electric vehicles dataset. I have used Python's bar_chart_race module for accomplishing this task.


# Task : Created an interactive Choropleth map :
* Using Plotly Express, visualizing the geographical distribution of EVs across regions. The power of data visualization never ceases to amaze!.


# CONCLUSION FROM THE ANALYSIS :
1. Electric Range Distribution :
    * The Analysis of electric ranges shows most Vehicles fall with in a typical range , with a few outliers having very high or low Ranges.
    * This may indicate a standarization of battery capacities in the market .
2. Legislative Districts :
    * The spread of Vehicles across various legislative districts suggests areas where infrastructure for electric vehicles (like charging) might need to be improved or is already well-established
# Over All Analysis :
* This Analysis highlights key trends in the electric vehicles , in terms of performance (electric range).
* The Visualizations , particually the bar chart race , provide a dynamic view of how manufactures are completing over time , while the histograms give a deeper understanding of the data distribution.
* This Information can be used by policymakers and manufactures to targetareas for improvement , such as increasing the electric vehicle range or expanding infrastructures in underserved locations .
